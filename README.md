To run the new code in server.js you need to install nodejs version 7 and use the following command line argument:
`node --harmony-async-await phantom_scripts/script.js`

To make sure the forgot password feature works, install the following node module:
`npm install nodemailer`

The profile page also has a "retype" password field, but it doesn't do anything right now. Needs to be implemented ASAP.
