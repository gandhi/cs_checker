To run the new code in server.js you need to install nodejs version 7 and use the following command line argument:
`npm start`

To run just the crawler, use the following command:
`npm run crawl`

To make sure the forgot password feature works, install the following node module:
`npm install nodemailer`

The profile page also has a "retype" password field, but it doesn't do anything right now. Needs to be implemented ASAP.
